## Project Overview


This project was created as part of our ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science) culminating project. Our goal was to build a **Computer Order Management System** for a computer building company. The system manages customer orders for both PCs and laptops, tracks their specific components, and keeps information about the order status (completed, canceled, shipped, etc.).
